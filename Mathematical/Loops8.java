/*
 * QUESTION - Write a program that takes a number from the user and prints the factorial of that number using
 * do-while loop. If the user enters a -ve number then print the message - "bhai, kya kar raha hai?".
 * Keep doing it until the user enters a +ve number.
 *
 * SOLUTION - Well, this problem is similar to the previous one in the part of taking input HOWEVER you have to use
 * the do-while loop.
 * Now, there are 2 parts of this question -
 * PART 1 : taking the input for variable 'n'
 * PART 2 : calculating the factorial of n using do-while loop.
 *
 * Let's do the PART 1 first.
 * There are 2 approaches to do this
 * APPROACH 1 - You can do it like the previous question. Using a while loop.
 * APPROACH 2 - Since you know that you have to take the input AT LEAST ONCE, why not use the do-while loop?
 * Put the condition as (n<0) - this will ensure that the loop will keep running until the value of n.
 *
 *
 * Now, the PART 2.
 * you can do it in 2 ways
 * APPROACH 1 - Do what you did in the previous question i.e. the logic of calculating factorial using a
 *              while / do-while / for loop.
 * APPROACH 2 - You can put the APPROACH 1 inside the APPROACH 2 of PART 1. i.e. nested do-while loops.
 *
 *
 * I will give you 2 combinations :
 * combination 1 : ( APPROACH 1 of PART 1     +      APPROACH 1 of PART 2 )
 * combination 2 : ( APPROACH 2 of PART 1     +      APPROACH 2 of PART 2 )
 *
 * you can try out other such combinations.
